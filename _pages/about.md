My name is Zeyu Wei but feel free to call me Jerry. I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Washington. 

I obtained my BS degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, majoring in Statistics, Mathematics, and Sociology, with a certificate in Computer Science. Thankfully, I had the opportunity to work on a project about Autoregressive Conditional Fr\'echet Model under the supervision of Professor [Zhengjun Zhang](http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~zjz/). My four years at UW-Madison are wonderful, with so many things learned in such a beautiful little city.

After joining the University of Washington Stats department,  I developed my interest in the topological features of data with the [Geometric Data Analysis Reading Group] (https://sites.stat.washington.edu/mmp/geometry/reading-group17/html/gda-home.html). I'm currently working with Professor [Yen-Chi Chen](http://faculty.washington.edu/yenchic/) on high-dimensional clustering problems and am excited about such explorations.

In my spare time, I enjoy all sorts of sports such as badminton, soccer, boxing, sailing, and hiking. I am a fan of souls-like games.
